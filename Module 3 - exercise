Finding Stories with Data – Module 3 - exercise

This is a remote module of the 5 module Finding Stories course. It’s intended to give you some challenges based on what we’ve covered so far, and particularly to see what you can do to get data into a specific format. The tools to be used are Excel/Googlesheets, and OpenRefine. Both can do the tasks set here. 

Challenge part 1 (optional) – pdf to spreadsheet. [This link](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSwD/blob/main/Gifts_visits_short.pdf) takes you so a relatively small list (37 names) of House of Commons staff who have declared receipt of Gifts or Hospitality. As in the real world, you may receive such data as a pdf file. 
Although you can ask the publisher to send it to you as csv/xls, you may want to convert it to those formats yourself. We recommend Tabula, but other methods are available, including CometDocs, see this [review page](https://pdf.wondershare.com/top-pdf-software/best-pdf-to-excel-converter.html) 

If you prefer, you can start here - 
Challenge part 2 – the pdf conversion should give you [this file](https://github.com/Stonepeople/FSwD/blob/main/Gifts_visits.xlsx) which has five columns and 37 rows. (NB – some of the entries in column 5 are so long they make the dataset very wide: in order to simplify the conversion process, we restricted the width of this column, so you will see that your conversion isn’t quite the same as this file – Gifts_visits.xlsx  This makes no difference to the exercises)
Column A contains the staff members’ family names in upper case, and column B their first names. Can you create a new column combining the names, all in one case (ie all upper, or with a capital first letter for each part), with “Firstname Surname”. 
	Hint – spreadsheet programs can do this using formulas such as UPPER, PROPER, and CONCATENATE. You may also want to try it in OpenRefine and see which you prefer. 
If you want more practice, try combining the MPs’ names into another new column, in one case, “SURNAME, FIRSTNAME” – ie, with a comma and space after the surname.
